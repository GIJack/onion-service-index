What is this?
=============

Originally this was a .onion. Not my .onion, but a rather useful enumeration of
.onion space done procedurally. I used this in combination with yacy, a java
search engine based on elastisearch and solr, to randomly probe .onion-land.

The site is no more, but after some searching, I was able to find the source
code and modify it to run locally, again to feed into yacy.
